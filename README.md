# visipark
A mobile app for visitor parking. Tenants use it to register their visitors and building managers use it to monitor visitor parking.

The goal of this project is to replace physical parking passes with a mobile app. 
To achieve this goal, two user interfaces were designed â€“ one for tenants and one for building managers. Tenants register their visitor's plate number in the app and the building manager will get an update of all visitors' vehicles parking in the lot.
